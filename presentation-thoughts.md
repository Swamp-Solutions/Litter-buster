# Presentation


## Roadmap
Visualize an overview of how the project works

## Gant Chart
We will be using Jira so we will get our Gant-Chart from there.
Explain time estimates using Gant-Chart

## Plan and perform a Demo
"Show the dinosaur first" - Start with demonstration to engage audience "How did they do that"
Present a sample product

" A persona is a fictional character created to represent a user group"
" Direct your demo to fit your persona group" 
If needed, create more than one demo.

Audience: 
- Students
- Teachers & course management
- As a property owner with many different rentees I want to be able to keep my customers accountable.
- As a government faculty I want to keep track of littering in public places and fine culprits.
- As a business owner I want to keep my employees responsible for leaving the workplace in a good condition.
- As a swamp proprietor I want to keep my swamp free from magical creatures and their residues
- As a Janitor I want to get notifications when there is litter
- 
- I'm an environmental freak and want to name and shame people who litter


## Steps to a good demo

### 1. Know your audience
- Large business
- Small 

### 2. Start with the problem
**Write User stories prior to the demo with your message**

you're a developer and you just spent 2 weeks writing this amazing app
your dream is to get it in front of every iphone user and hopefully they love and buy it

Most developers don't have that kind of resources
We will solve that problem for developers big and small
Introducing "The app store"
Our developers will be able to reach everyone

You want to find a business application
You want to find a game

I want to find the most popular apps

I know what I want and can search for it

You downloaded an app and want to keep it up to date and want to be able to update clicking a simple button

Developers are gonna ask: What's the deal
The developer wants to pick the price and get a large portion of the revenue

The developer wants to disstribute their app for free and want to give it out for free. - store 

We want to distribute a lot of apps with the app store

### 3. Tell a Story
Use storytelling in your demos, tell a story of a user and how they're using your product in a time of need.
Then show functionalities and how to use


#### People do not like change!
Show how you keep previous infrastructure.
Example - "Pythonic" software libraries for python developers.






## Steve Jobs launch Iphone
Show what you've done in the past. 
What changes you've created before.
Today we're introducing three such products
And they're all the same product
Showing how their new product is separate from other products
**Adding a Joke**
Smartphone - email + internet + phone
Showing a visualization of how Iphone is both smart and easy to use

We already solved the problems with the buttons
We display clear demonstrations of the advantages of our products to products already on the market
Then comes the pitch


# Do's and Don'ts
Backup plan with slides
Speak slowly, It's okay to have pauses.
Focus on a few key points, no more than 4
Bring a colleague to the demo, someone to help with the demonstration.

X Don't show every feature, only the "Hype"
