### Scripts
Folder containing scripts mostly related to handling image files. \
##### Resolution:
- chkres.py : Checks the resolution of each image in the folder and creates a list of the ones on the lower end.
- chkres_dirs.py : Had a situation where we wanted to use chkres.py to check the number of resolutions < 640 per directory
