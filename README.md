## Project plan

### Objectives

1. Train machine learning models to identify faces.
2. Train machine learning model to recognize faces in images.
3. We will also build a machine learning model to recognize littering.
4. Create a backend-application to run the machine-learning functions.
5. Lastly there will be an application to view instances of littering from a database.
6. Create a database structure to catalog the classified images.
7. Build an application to send images of littering to an email-adress.
8. Create a dashboard showing data and predictions.

### Methods
