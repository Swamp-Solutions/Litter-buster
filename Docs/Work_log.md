Takes an image as input, checks against a log if a mail has been sent within a set time(standard 4 hours) and sends a mail with the image attachement if there's been no mail.

Started learning model.

### 2023-02-08 :
##### Create video-conversion-function
Created a python-function that can take as input a video without predictions and return a video with predictions done. 
##### Finished first version of model
Needs a lot of work. Running another attempt with freeze 12 at the end, frozen layers which should help a lot with making an accurate model. \
Also added more background-images. \
Will look to do one full 150 epoch run with frozen layers.

##### Created scripts to evaluate pictures
We have an issue where the pictures are in extremely different resolutions. Some pictures are lower than the learning resolution which causes problems.
