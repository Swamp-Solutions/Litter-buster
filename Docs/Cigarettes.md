### Steps used in this objective.(Yolov5 learning)
1. Download Yolov5 pytorch and cuda(Graphics driver for using the GPU in Learning)
   - I opted for using google colab instead that has all these dependencies pre-installed which makes for a much easier running experience.
   - Did not get Cuda and pytorch to work together on my computer but I had no issues using them on google colab.
2. Use labelImg locally on my computer to create labels for the images.
3. Created a google colab environment to run the code and train the model.
